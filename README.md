# UniveralRAGChatSurveillance

## Overview
UniveralRAGChatSurveillance is a Python-based project designed to integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with chat functionalities for surveillance data analysis. This repository provides tools to process, retrieve, and interact with surveillance-related data using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines information retrieval with generative AI to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Chat Interface**: Enables interactive querying of surveillance data through a conversational interface.
- **Data Processing**: Supports processing of various surveillance data formats for analysis.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle large datasets efficiently using modern Python libraries.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Includes scripts for deploying the application on Kubernetes clusters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (optional, for orchestration)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mpwusr/univeralRAGChatSurveillance.git
   cd univeralRAGChatSurveillance
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configurations, such as API keys or database credentials:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Application Locally**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This starts the chat interface and RAG pipeline for querying surveillance data.

2. **Interact via Chat**:
   - Access the chat interface through the provided endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/chat`).
   - Enter queries related to surveillance data, and the system will retrieve and generate responses.

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes** (Optional):
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t univeral-rag-chat-surveillance .
     ```
   - Apply Kubernetes manifests:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
     ```
